# Learning_Python_and_ML

For my first contact with this programming language, I'm really proud of my achivement :) 

So I decided to gather here all the projects that i've worked throughout the course of Python and ML on Udemy by Jose Portilla (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
