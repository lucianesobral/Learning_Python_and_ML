# Learning_Python_and_ML

For my first contact with this programming language, I'm really proud of my achievement :) 

So I decided to gather here all the projects that i've worked throughout the course of Python and ML by Jose Portilla (Pierian-Data) on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) 

My certificate of completion: https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-95783f63-69fa-4876-a625-9e8ebb0a11cd/

(gathering still under construction)
